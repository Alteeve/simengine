 # Simengine Demo
 
-Resources for demoing the simengine / anvil dashboards
 
-## Aquiring and running simengine-demo script
+For anyone looking to demo or test an example of [Simengine](https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/simengine) running with the [Alteeve Anvil model](https://simengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Anvil%20Model/).
+
+A bash script and desktop file providing CLI and GUI options for downloading and setting up a virtual environment that is pre-configured for simengine, running an example of the Anvil model. The script also provides access to the simengine dashboard for managing the model through GUI, as well as the Anvil! dashboard.
+
+### System Requirements
+
+Fedora Linux 35+
+
+32GB RAM
+
+150GB+ available storage space
+
+[libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) installed

+
+For users that prefer working through GUI [follow these instructions](#GUI-based-Installation).
+
+
+### CLI-based Installation
+
+
+#### 1. Installing simengine repo file
+
+Executing this command in your terminal will install a repo file for simengine, providing [DNF](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/) access to the rpm package for simengine-demo and additional simengine packages, should you wish to install them.
 
-### Installing simengine repo file:
 ```bash
 sudo dnf install http://england.cdot.systems/simengine/simengine-repo-3.42-1.fc35.noarch.rpm
 ```
 
-### Installing simengine-demo script and desktop file:
+#### 2. Installing simengine-demo
+
+With the repo file installed, execute this command to install the rpm package for simengine-demo:
+
 ```bash
 sudo dnf install simengine-demo
 ```
 
-### Downloading and unpacking simengine vm:
+#### 3. Downloading simengine vm image
+
+With the previous package installed, you now have access to the simengine-demo script.
+
+Execute the following command to begin downloading the simengine virtual machine image, you can monitor the progress in the terminal.
 
-Command line:
 ```bash
 simengine-demo --download
 ```
 
-Desktop file:
-```
-right click, select "Download"
+#### 4. Setting up simengine
+
+Next execute this command to install the simengine VM with the image downloaded:
+
+```bash
+simengine-demo --setup
 ```
 
-Note: Through the command line you will be able to monitor progress of the download, through the desktop file this feature is absent at the momment.
+#### 5. Accessing the simengine and anvil dashboards
 
+Executing the simengine-demo script with no additional options will start the simengine VM, and begin the process of verifying the status of the Anvil model simulation, completing by opening the Simengine and Anvil! dashboards.
 
-## Setting up simengine
+Execute this command to get started:
 
-command line: 
 ```bash
-simengine-demo --setup
+simengine-demo
 ```
 
-desktop file: 
-```
-right click, select "Setup"
-```
+NOTE: The startup process can take anywhere between 4-10 minutes, it takes a significant amount of time for each system and necessary service to get started.
+
+Upon success you should have two browser tabs opened to the simengine and anvil dashboards, all done!
+
+#### 6. Shutting down the simengine VM
+
+If the startup fails and ends with the error message "Inner vms unreachable" it's best to shut down the simengine vm and try again.
 
-## Accessing the simengine and anvil dashboards
+You can shut it down by executing the command:
 
-Assuming all has went well, all that's left any time you would like to access the dashboard is:
-    
-command line:
 ```bash
-simengine-demo

+```
 
-If the startup fails and ends with the error message "Inner vms unreachable" it's best to shut down the simengine vm and try again.
+#### 4. Accessing the simengine and anvil dashboards
 
-You can shut it down with ``` simengine-demo --shutdown ```, right clicking the desktop file and selecting "Shutdown", or through virsh yourself targeting "simengine"
